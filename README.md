# AI-UIST-IST-MLDATASET

This project consists of three phases, each addressing different aspects of artificial intelligence. The implementation is divided into various problems, and each problem is solved using different techniques and programming languages.

## Uninformed Search Techniques

### Social Golfers Problem
- **Description:** A problem where a group of golfers needs to be scheduled to play in groups over several weeks, with certain constraints.
- **Solutions:**
  1. **DFS Solution (Python):** `UnInformed_Search_Technique/SocialGolfersProblem/DFS.py`
  2. **BFS Solution (Python):** `UnInformed_Search_Technique/SocialGolfersProblem/BFS.py`

### Sudoku Solver
- **Description:** Solving Sudoku puzzles using uninformed search techniques.
- **Solutions:**
  1. **DFS Backtracking Solution (C#):** `UnInformed_Search_Technique/Sudoku/SudokuSolverB_DFS.cs`
  2. **BFS Backtracking Solution (C#):** `UnInformed_Search_Technique/Sudoku/SudokuSolver_BFS..cs`

### Running the Programs
- For each problem, navigate to the respective directory and run the corresponding Python or C# file.

## Informed Search Techniques

### NQueens Problem
- **Description:** Placing N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard with no two queens threatening each other.
- **Solution:** `Informed_Search_Technique/NQueens/Nqueens.sln`

### Sudoku Solver
- **Description:** Solving Sudoku puzzles using constraint programming.
- **Solution:** `Informed_Search_Technique/SudokuCSP/SudokuCSP.sln`

### Seating 100 Guests Problem
- **Description:** Seating 100 guests at 10 tables with 10 seats using Python's ortool library and Boolean Satisfiability Problem (SAT).
- **Solution:** `Informed_Search_Technique/SAT Problem/SAT_solution.py`

### Running the Programs
- Follow the instructions in each problem directory to execute the programs.

## Machine Learning Models

### Job Stability Prediction
- **Description:** Training models to predict job stability based on dataset features.
- **Models:**
  1. **LightGBM:** `ML Algorithm/data_preprocessing.ipynb`
  2. **XGBoost:** `ML Algorithm/data_preprocessing.ipynb`
  3. **CatBoost ( use Python Interpreter 3.11.1):** `ML Algorithm/data_preprocessing.ipynb`



### Running the Models
1. Open the Jupyter notebook for all models.
2. Execute the cells to train and evaluate the models.

Note: Ensure that the required libraries and dependencies are installed before running the programs.
